Drug discovery is one of the most dynamic and rapidly evolving areas of AI in healthcare. Here are some of the key new developments and ongoing trends:\n\n**1. Generative AI for Novel Molecule Design:**\nThis is a huge area of excitement. Instead of just screening existing compounds, generative AI models (similar to those that create text or images) are now being used to **design entirely new molecules** with desired properties.\n*   **How it works:** These models learn the \"rules\" of molecular structure and chemistry from vast datasets and can then propose novel chemical structures that are predicted to bind to a specific target protein or have other beneficial characteristics.\n*   **Impact:** This could drastically reduce the time and cost of identifying promising drug candidates, as researchers aren't limited to what's already known.\n\n**2. AI for Predicting Drug Efficacy and Toxicity:**\nAI is moving beyond just finding potential drug candidates to predicting how effective they might be and if they will be safe.\n*   **In silico trials:** AI can simulate how a drug might behave in the body and in clinical trials, helping to identify potential failures earlier in the process.\n*   **Predicting side effects:** By analyzing complex biological pathways and patient data, AI can flag potential toxicity issues before a drug even reaches human trials.\n\n**3. Deep Learning for Target Identification:**\nAI is helping researchers pinpoint the specific biological targets (like proteins or genes) that a disease relies on and that a drug could interact with.\n*   **Analyzing multi-omics data:** AI can integrate and analyze vast amounts of data from genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, and other \"omics\" fields to identify novel drug targets that might be missed by traditional methods.\n*   **Understanding disease mechanisms:** This deeper understanding of disease biology allows for the development of more precise and effective therapies.\n\n**4. AI in Repurposing Existing Drugs:**\nInstead of developing new drugs from scratch, AI can identify existing drugs that might be effective for new conditions.\n*   **Screening vast databases:** AI algorithms can quickly scan databases of approved drugs and match their known mechanisms of action or molecular properties to the needs of different diseases.\n*   **Benefits:** This can significantly speed up the development process and reduce costs, as the safety profiles of existing drugs are already well-established.\n\n**5. AI-Powered Automation of Lab Experiments:**\nWhile not directly *discovering* drugs, AI is increasingly integrated into laboratory automation, which indirectly accelerates discovery.\n*   **Robotic synthesis and screening:** AI can optimize the design and execution of experiments, controlling robotic systems that perform high-throughput screening of compounds and reactions.\n*   **Data analysis and feedback loops:** AI analyzes the results of these experiments in real-time and provides feedback to refine future experiments, creating efficient learning loops.\n\n**6.

This is a critical area because many promising drug candidates fail in late-stage clinical trials or after market approval due to a lack of efficacy or unforeseen safety issues. AI is helping to mitigate these risks.\n\nHere's a deeper dive into how AI is used for predicting drug efficacy and toxicity:\n\n**1. In Silico (Computational) Trials and Simulations:**\n\n*   **What it is:** Instead of immediately testing a drug in animals or humans, AI models can simulate how a drug is likely to behave within a biological system. This involves modeling the drug's interaction with its target, its absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) in the body, and its potential off-target effects.\n*   **How it helps Efficacy:**\n    *   **Predicting binding affinity:** AI can predict how strongly a drug candidate will bind to its intended target protein. A stronger, more specific binding often correlates with higher efficacy.\n    *   **Simulating cellular responses:** AI models can predict the downstream effects of drug-target interaction at the cellular level, indicating whether the drug will trigger the desired therapeutic pathway.\n    *   **Identifying optimal dosing:** Simulations can help determine the most effective dose range, maximizing therapeutic benefit while minimizing side effects.\n*   **How it helps Toxicity:**\n    *   **Predicting off-target binding:** AI can identify if a drug candidate is likely to bind to unintended proteins, which is a common cause of side effects.\n    *   **Metabolic pathway analysis:** AI can predict how the body will break down the drug and whether any of the resulting metabolites are toxic.\n    *   **Cardiotoxicity prediction:** Specific AI models are trained to predict the risk of a drug affecting heart function (e.g., QT prolongation).\n    *   **Hepatotoxicity prediction:** Predicting potential liver damage.\n\n**2. Machine Learning Models Trained on Historical Data:**\n\n*   **What it is:** Researchers train machine learning models on vast datasets of past drug development successes and failures. This data includes information about drug properties, their biological targets, experimental results (both in vitro and in vivo), and clinical trial outcomes.\n*   **How it works:** The AI learns complex patterns and correlations between various molecular and biological features and eventual drug efficacy or toxicity.\n*   **Efficacy Prediction:**\n    *   **Predicting clinical success:** Models can be trained to predict the probability of a drug candidate successfully passing Phase II or Phase III clinical trials based on its preclinical data.\n    *   **Stratifying patient populations:** For drugs where efficacy might vary, AI can identify biomarkers or patient characteristics that predict who is most likely to respond well to the treatment.\n*   **Toxicity Prediction:**\n    *   **Early warning systems:** Models can flag compounds with a high likelihood of causing specific types of toxicity (e.g., genotoxicity, immunotoxicity) based on their chemical structure or preliminary experimental data.\n    *   **Identifying problematic substructures:** AI can learn to recognize specific chemical groups or structural motifs that are often associated with toxicity.\n\n**3. Integrating Multi-Modal Data:**\n\n*   **What it is:** The most powerful AI models integrate diverse data sources, including:\n    *   **Chemical structure information:** The 3D structure and chemical properties of the drug.\n    *   **Biological pathway data:** Knowledge of how genes and proteins interact.\n    *   **Genomic and proteomic data:** Information about the patient's or target organism's biology.\n    *   **Experimental assay results:** Data from laboratory tests.\n    *   **Real-world evidence (RWE):** Post-market surveillance data, patient registries.\n*   **Benefits:** By analyzing these integrated datasets, AI can gain a more holistic understanding of a drug's potential impact, leading to more accurate predictions of both efficacy and toxicity.\n\n**Key Advantages of AI in this Area:**\n\n*   **De-risking:** Identifying potential failures much earlier in the R&D pipeline saves enormous amounts of time and money.\n*   **Accelerating development:** By providing better predictions, AI helps prioritize the most promising candidates and move them forward faster.\n*   **Improving safety:** Ultimately, this leads to safer drugs reaching patients.\n*   **Personalization:** AI can help predict efficacy and toxicity for specific patient subgroups, paving the way for more personalized medicine.\n\nThis development is crucial because it directly addresses one of the biggest bottlenecks and costs in drug development: the high failure rate of candidates that don't work or aren't safe.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the companies involved in **AI for predicting drug efficacy and toxicity**.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer. For more advanced use cases, you can provide your own by defining a custom `SlidingWindowCompactor` and passing it to the config. This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
